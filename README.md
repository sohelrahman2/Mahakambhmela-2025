Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 – Data Journey & Analysis  
📌 Overview  
This project analyzes the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025, the world’s largest public gathering, held in Prayagraj from January 13 – February 26, 2025.  
The aim was to transform scattered, incomplete data into a clean, structured dataset and produce actionable insights through Power BI visualization.  

Problem Statement     
The Maha Kumbh Mela is the world’s largest gathering, attracting millions of people over weeks.  
Managing such an event is a massive challenge for authorities due to:  
Unpredictable visitor footfall across different days & Ghats.  
High demand for meal distribution and waste management.  
Ensuring public safety, with medical emergencies and security incidents.  
Lack of structured, real-time data to guide decisions.  
When I began, there was no centralized dataset available online. Data existed only in scattered news articles, with missing values and inconsistencies.  

My Approach  
Data Collection – Extracted information from news sources like Times of India.  
Data Structuring – Converted text snippets into Excel tables.  
Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT – Generated projections after refining prompts.  
Data Cleaning – Fixed missing values using mean, median, and standard deviation.   
Power BI Dashboard – Built a visualization to track footfall, meals, waste, medical, and security trends.   

⚙️ Process   
Data Discovery – Gathered fragmented details from news reports.  
Prompt Engineering – Structured raw projections using ChatGPT after multiple iterations.  
Data Cleaning – Filled missing values using mean, median, and standard deviation.  
 Validation – Ensured logical consistency and alignment with event context.  
Visualization – Imported into Power BI for analysis & dashboard creation.  

📊 Key Insights  
Dashashwamedh Ghat had the highest footfall & meals served.  
Rainy & sunny days drew the largest crowds.  
Fridays were peak for meal distribution.  
Medical & security incidents clustered in high-footfall Ghats.  

💡 Skills & Tools  
Skills: Data sourcing, cleaning, validation, prompt engineering, analytics, storytelling. 
Tools: Excel, ChatGPT, Power BI.  

🚀 Outcome  
The project showcases the complete data lifecycle — from raw text fragments to actionable insights.  
It demonstrates problem-solving under data scarcity, essential for real-world analytics and decision-making.  

✅ By using Power BI dashboards, authorities can:
Predict crowd surges and deploy police, medical teams, and volunteers in advance.  
Plan meal distribution efficiently, avoiding shortages or wastage.    
Track waste generation and schedule timely cleanups.   
Identify high-risk Ghats for focused medical & security preparedness.   

🌍 Impact:  
This approach can transform Maha Kumbh Mela from being just a logistical challenge into a data-driven, well-managed event—improving safety, resource utilization, and overall visitor experience
